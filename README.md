## [Description](#c_desc)

PHiLIP is qualified open-source firmware for nucleo-f103rb or bluepill boards used for testing peripherals of other embedded devices.
PHiLIP is a low-cost solution to allow detailed, corner case peripheral testing for both developers and CI systems.
PHiLIP is aimed at getting salient information that would be gathered from an oscilloscope or logic analyzer as well as injecting specific peripheral behaviors.
PHiLIP is designed for testing peripheral APIs for embedded operating systems and hardware abstraction layers but was built with an architecture that allows for _easy_ extensions to other applications such as product qualification or simulation.
PHiLIP can be used with a raw serial connection but also comes with a python interface that simplifies writing test scripts as well as a shell for developers to run manual tests.

<a name="setup"></a>
## [Setup of PHiLIP Environment](#c_setup)
The setup will explain how to flash PHiLIP and install the python interface.
To setup the PHiLIP environment some hardware will be required, either a nucleo-f103rb or a bluepill with a usb to uart converter.

#### 1. Connect PHiLIP pins
For the nucleo-f103rb only the usb connection is required.
The bluepill will require a uart connection to `A9 - IF_TX` to the uart RX pin and the `A10 - IF_RX` to the uart TX pin.
See the [PHiLIP-b pinout](RESOURCES/PHiLIP-BLUEPILL-PINOUT.png) for more information.
The uart is needed for the basic interface but can also be used for ROM UART flashing.
To flash the bluepill with SWD, connect the swd pins and reset `R - NRST` pin.


#### 2. Flash PHiLIP to the device
The qualified firmware for PHiLIP is stored in the [PHiLIP Releases](https://github.com/riot-appstore/PHiLIP/releases).
The correct firmware is needed for the given board, either the [PHiLIP_BLUEPILL](https://github.com/riot-appstore/PHiLIP/releases/download/v1.0.2/PHiLIP-BLUEPILL.bin) or the [PHiLIP_NUCLEO-F103RB](https://github.com/riot-appstore/PHiLIP/releases/download/v1.0.2/PHiLIP-NUCLEO-F103RB.bin).
To flash the firmware on the nucleo-f103rb, drag and drop the .bin file to the nucleo device.
There are many ways to flash the bluepill, either by connecting a swd connector or with the [ROM UART bootloader](https://medium.com/@paramaggarwal/programming-an-stm32f103-board-using-usb-port-blue-pill-953cec0dbc86).
After flashing PHiLIP should be blinking the firmware revision pattern (_1 + the firmware number, so firmware revision 1.0.3 would blink 2, 1, 4 times_).

_HINT: If flashing a nucleo-f103rb with a ubuntu machine use the following command_

`wget -P /media/${USER}/NODE_F103RB/ https://github.com/riot-appstore/PHiLIP/releases/download/v1.0.2/PHiLIP-NUCLEO-F103RB.bin
`

#### 3. Install the Python Interface (philip_pal)
The philip_pal is only python3 so use the following command to install:

`sudo pip3 install philip_pal`

<a name="gs_dev"></a>
## [Getting Started as a Developer](#c_gs_dev)
_First follow the [setup](#setup)_

To use PHiLIP as a developer, an interface shell `philip_shell` is provided with the [philip_pal package](IF/philip_pal).
The philip_shell has a connect wizard, command history, and auto-completion.
If in doubt, try pressing tab a few times or typing in `help`.

The following is an example of PHiLIP running and evaluating a toggling pin.
This should show how to use the different functionalities of PHiLIP such as:
- Reading different parameters
- Setting configurations with a single command
- Prepared multiple configuration changes then executing

This should provide a way to get started using PHiLIP.
Run the philip shell with `philip_shell` _(use the -h to view additional args)_

#### 1. Exploring the philip_shell

1. Check available commands with `help`, this shows each of the commands.
For information of each of the commands type `help <topic>`
```
PHiLIP: help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
data_filter      exit         info_record_type  read_reg     show_pinout      
dut_reset        get_version  philip_reset      read_struct  write_and_execute
execute_changes  help         print_map         read_trace   write_reg
```

2. Check the description of the memory map.
This should help explain what each register is responsible for.
The registers or memory map records are the primary way to configure and get data.
```
info_record_type description
```

3. Check the pinout of the philip.
This give an idea on where the connect pins on the board.
```
show_pinout
```

4. Connect the `DUT_RST` to the `DEBUG0` pin.
5. Check what the `gpio[0].mode.io_type` register does.
This shows the functionality of the register, in this case allowing us to set the type of GPIO pin mode.
```
print_map gpio[0].mode.io_type
```
6. Enable the `DEBUG0` or gpio0 pin to interrupt mode so traces can be collected.
Since traces can capture events from the interrupt we must enable the interrupt.
```
write_and_execute gpio[0].mode.io_type 3
```
7. Use the `DUT_RST` pin to toggle events on the `DEBUG0` pin.
By toggling the `DUT_RST` pin the trace events get logged.
```
dut_reset
```

8. Verify the events are logged in a human-readable way.
```
read_trace
```

9. Read the basic tick registers of the trace.
The is the basic register information without any processing.
Many register values can be interrogated in this way.
```
read_reg trace.tick
```

10. Only read the first two elements of the array.
This shows how read registers with arrays.
```
read_reg trace.tick 0 2
```

11. Now read the whole trace structure.
```
read_struct trace
```

12. Toggle the data filter off to see very verbose details of the tick traces
```
data_filter
read_struct trace
```

13. Now reset philip back to the default state.
```
data_filter on
philip_reset
```

14. Manually prepare the rtc time.
This shows how to prepare the data that must be executed at the same time.
```
write_reg rtc.set_minute 4
write_reg rtc.set_hour 14
write_reg rtc.set_day 100
```

15. Clear the rtc.mode.init bit to reinitialize and set rtc values on execute.
```
write_reg rtc.mode.init 0
```

16. Execute the changes.
The first checks to see if the module needs to be reinitialized then performs the initialization when executed.
```
execute_changes
```

17. Read the new RTC time and confirm changes propagated.
```
read_struct rtc
```

18. Notice that the second was reset to 0 because that is the default time.

#### 2. The Process of Updating the Runtime Configuration of PHiLIP

To actually change the PHiLIP configuration, a number of steps must occur:
1. Write the register intended to change
2. Set the module init bit to 0
3. Execute changes

or use the `write_and_execute` command that does all of the listed steps.

## [Getting Started with CI Scripts](#c_gs_ci)
_First follow the [setup](#setup)_

To use the python interface in a CI, a Phil class is provided.
Create a python script for the CI to run and import Phil to use.
Refer to the [philip_if.py](/IF/philip_pal/philip_pal/philip_if.py) for more information.

Example of python test script that tests the trace function.
_connect the `DUT_RST` to the `DEBUG0` pin._

```python
from philip_pal import Phil

phil = Phil()
print("interface version: {}".format(phil.if_version))

# Reset philip to a clean state
assert phil.reset_mcu()['result'] == phil.RESULT_SUCCESS

# Setup DEBUG0 pin to log trace events with interrupt
for result in phil.write_and_execute('gpio[0].mode.io_type', 3):
    # Check each result for success
    assert result['result'] == phil.RESULT_SUCCESS

# Toggle the DUT_RST pin for the default period
phil.dut_reset()

# Toggle the DUT_RST pin for 1 second
phil.dut_reset(1.0)

trace = phil.read_trace()

# Assert the second toggle was in fact about 1 second
elapse_time = trace[3]['time'] - trace[2]['time']
assert elapse_time > 0.9 and elapse_time < 1.1

print("Trace Results")
print(trace)
```

## [PHiLIP Infrastructure](#c_arch)
PHiLIP uses a combination of tools in order to work.
The [memory_map_manager](https://github.com/riot-appstore/memory_map_manager) or MMM help maintain and coordinate the memory map used for the firmware, documentation, and interface.
The [philip_pal](IF/philip_pal) wraps around the basic serial protocol so functionality can be implemented and handled with a higher level language and in a non-constrained environment.
The initial version used [STM32Cube](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html), however, the generator is being deprecated in this project due to lack of portability.

## [PHiLIP Memory Map](#c_map)
The memory map is a way to access a large amount of information in a compact way.
With the [memory_map_manager](https://github.com/riot-appstore/memory_map_manager), firmware, documentation, and interfaces are all coordinated with a single config file.
This makes changes easy to manage, for example, if a field for reporting if an i2c fails to ACK on data is needed, that field can be added to the config file.
After updating the map it can be accessed from the interface to the firmware.
The current versioned memory maps is available [here](IF/philip_pal/philip_pal/mem_map).

## [Design FAQs](#c_faq)
### Why not use a tool (like buspirate) that does this already?
- Standard test tools from DIOLAN and Total Phase require licenses and are expensive
- Most tools don't achieve everything needed, that is why it would be good to customize firmware

### Why not just test against sensors?
- Sensors and other slave devices cannot test all configurable modes (try to find a SPI MODE 3 or 4 device)

### Why not use a Raspberry Pi?
- RPi does not support low level testing
- RPi's drivers are not well certified

### Why not use Arduino?
- Standard Arduino extensions don't support all configurable features well
- Arduino hardware doesn't support everything

### Why not implement in RIOT or any other OS?
- If the device is using RIOT then it shouldn't be tested on RIOT, it should be tested against an accepted reference
- The tester should be minimal to not introduce unnecessary overhead
- RIOT doesn't support many slave features

### Are the peripheral pins static or reassignable?
- Pins are static, this makes them simple to wire and simple to develop

### Why program the PHiLIP bare metal (or using STMCube)?
- STMCube provides a standard reference to start so boilerplate code doesn't need to be implemented, tested, and debugged
- Bare metal is used since the application features are generally simple and an RTOS is not needed
- If alterations are made in the future it is not necessary to update or bring in a new RTOS

### How dependent is the PHiLIP on the library (STMCube and CMSIS)?
- Slowly moving away from STMCube library, it was used for getting it started

### What are the final thoughts?
- The most efficient way to assist RIOT is to quickly deploy a usable system, so far this is the best/fastest/most reliable way to do so
- Additional support for slave peripherals can be added after knowledge is gained from the baremetal development
